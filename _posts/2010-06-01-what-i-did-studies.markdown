What I did from 2008 to 2009 during my studies?

It was the 2nd of my 3 years of engineering school, at the *Institut Supérieur de l’Électronique et du Numérique* (ISEN), in Brest, France, in a **software engineering specialization**.

Between partying, sleeping in class or working on my personal projects, I also did some stuff in order to have my degree. Here is two of my last works. 

------------------------

Database project
----------------

    Deployment of an incident tickets management system
The purpose of this project was the study of a database management system *(SGBD)*, and the design and development of a website managing incident tickets, with users and administrators access. The *SGBD* used here was **MySQL**, and the website was coded with **PHP**, **HTML** (4), **CSS** (2) and some hidden **javascript**.

Virtual Lab project
----------------

    Deployment of the Virtual Lab, part of the project Emulaction

In june 2004, a study has been done concerning the students of the ISEN-Brest in order to better understand the way they use their laptops. This study revealed that 80% of the time they used their computer was for surfing on the internet, doing school work or playing video games. From this study was born the idea to create a **system of learning through an online video-gaming tool**.

In 2005, the ISEN set up a **Virtual Electronic Laboratory** (VELab), in order to give the users the possibility to do electronics  experiments in a 3D environment, on the web. Very innovative and answering most of the needs, it still has some problems: the user  had to install the 3D rendering plugin , and the Java plugin creating the link to the server. Moreover, the techno used in 2005 were, in 2008, obsolete, as the Microsoft Java virtual machine.

The Virtual Lab was **developed in VRML** and the sharing of the labs between several users used an **obsolete technology: Deepmatrix**. The work asked was to find a way to make the virtual laboratory up to date and usable.
