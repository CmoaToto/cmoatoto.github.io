Today, while I surveyed, as all days, the "[genymotion](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=genymotion&src=typd)" results in Twitter, [Sergey Ryabov](https://twitter.com/colriot) asked [this question](https://twitter.com/colriot/status/588645473164140544):

> [@Genymotion](https://twitter.com/genymotion) Consider a feature request. How about adding Custom Locale with [Redacted font](https://github.com/christiannaths/Redacted-Font)? Is it even possible?

As I answered,  with several 140 chars messages, that it could be possible, this might be possible, but there is almost no chance to add it to a close backlog...

But why would he want to do that. And Font is Font, Locale is Locale, there is no real point to change the Font when changing the Locale. Maybe for different languages with different symbols, graphemes or writing systems but nor much more.
